I charge 680â‚¬ per day.

But I do not accept payments unless my clients are delighted.
And if I do not meet the agreed deadline, I will waive off 50% of the price.
If I deliver early, you only pay up to that day.
I won't charge for projects with schools, non-profit organizations, or other honorary endeavors.

If you want to know why I would be qualified to do all this, take a look at my [CV/Resume](/resume/).
For insights into how I work and in which environments I thrive, check out [My user manual: How to work with me](/manual/).

[Send me an email](mailto:hi@flokoe.de) if you're interested in working together.
The first consultation and getting to know each other is free!

## What services do I offer?

Startup emergencies, system/infrastructure architecture, container orchestration, performance issues, database problems, legacy systems, dispute resolution, and increasing communication and productivity.
Furthermore, I have experience in team management and as a tech lead and can provide trainings/workshops, or talks.
I have a broad spectrum of skills, but it's always difficult to assess if I am a good fit for you.
Send me a message, and let's work it out together whether I can help.

**Configuration management and infrastructure as code:**
Automate and control software/infrastructure as code via version control systems like Git.

**Automation, pipelines, CI/CD:**
How to deliver software, platform engineering, automating software deployments and configuration, internal development platform.

**Full/partial server management:**
Monitoring of metrics or logs, for example via the Grafana stack, and responding to alerts.

## Why the high price?

I value your time as much as mine.
The value I provide does not come from the time I need for a task, but from the time and effort I put in to gain the experience to solve your problems quickly in a way that suits you best.
