description: I love Open Source and work as a DevOps Engineer. I got a degree in Information Technology, but I am mostly self-taught. I focus on high available systems, Linux, security and automation.

My name is Florian KÃ¶hler, and I live around Hamburg, Germany. I am an Open Source enthusiast and work as a DevOps Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, System Administrator, or whatever you call it nowadays. I got a degree in Information Technology, but most of my knowledge is self-taught.

I now got about {{% years_of_exp %}} years of experience in tech, where I worked with big companies all around Germany. During this time, I learned many different skills and got to know various perspectives of entrepreneurship.

Currently, my focus lies on high availability systems, GNU/Linux, mainly Debian, security, automation (Puppet, pipelines, etc.), databases, and everything around web hosting. In general, I enjoy learning about computers, automation, security, and a bit of entrepreneurship.

This blog is for me to remember how things work and for everyone else interested in tech. Maybe you find an interesting read or two.

Not all entries on this page are complete, as I try to publish early and often. I will try my best to mark all posts that are still work in progress.
